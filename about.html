        <h1>About Me</h1>
     <p>MONOLITH.IC  <br>
        <br>considered as my artist name based on a story that i have overcome in the past, it means a lot to me. This name also helped me establish 
        myself on social media where i post my creative work. Photography holds a special place in my heart, it's one of my hobbies after basketball. 
        I love capturing moments that reveal the beauty and emotion found in everyday life. Through my lens, I strive to tell stories and showcase viewpoints that might otherwise be overlooked. 
        In addition to my creative and academic endeavors, I find balance and vitality on the basketball court. 
        Engaging in the sport keeps me active, fosters teamwork, and allows me to channel my competitive nature into something both dynamic and fulfilling.

     <p2>"NN"<br>
        <br>for Nhung Ngo, alternatively i go by Hazel.
         Currently, I am a computing student at Goldsmiths and it has bought me so much fun 
         learning about the fast-paced world of technology. The course is equipping me for the internet-influenced future.
         Simultaneously, I am working as a chef part-time. As a chef, I take great pride in transforming fresh ingredients 
         into amazing dishes that hold a story, blending flavors and textures to craft experiences that bring people together.
